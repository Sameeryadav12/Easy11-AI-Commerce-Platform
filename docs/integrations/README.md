# Reference Integrations (Stubs)

This folder contains stubs and quickstarts for initial integrations targeted in Sprint 18.

- Shopify Importer: outline of product/order delta sync.
- Shippo Label: sample request/response and webhook handler.
- NetSuite Export: pseudo-code for order/payout export.

In dev, these provide code samples and API shapes; production connectors will require partner credentials and certified sandboxes.
